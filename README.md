# Restraunt-Management-System

I have created a consol based Restraunt Management program in java, using the concept of object oriented programming. The Program has 3 types of users namely Manager, Cashier and Waiter. Waiter is the base class with minimum rights and functionalities, cashier class inherits waiter class and has some additional functionalities and rights. Manager class is at the leaf of multilevel inheritance and has the highest rights. 

**Functionalities of Waiter Class**
- Take Order
  
**Functionalities of Cashier Class**
- Take Order
- Print Bill
- Add customer's details
- View customer's details

**Functionalities of Manager Class**
- Add customer's details
- view customer's details
- Add staff details
- View staff details

`

  Here are the scree-shots of the program.
